OTRSCMDExplorer
===============

This OTRS package provides a graphical explorer to the OTRS CMDB.

It is based on the excellent work from Dietmar Berg, ITSMTrace (version 0.8.1).

CMDBExplorer differs from ITSMTrace by the following characteristics:

  1- The image generated is integrated in the AgentITSMConfigItemZoon screen;
  2- The image initialy shows only first level links. But is interactive, so that the agent can click on a node/CI to further develop the vizualisation of the links;
  3- A lot of CMDBExplorer parameters are configurable via SysConfig settings.
